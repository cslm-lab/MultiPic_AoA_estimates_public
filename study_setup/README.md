# Study setup
This directory contains all data, exploration and final code which serve as the base for creating our age-of-acquisition questionnaire.

## data
Contains information on which MultiPic items were used in which questionnaire list, as well as overviews which example sentences were used for each word item. 
Furthermore, English translations of the word items + example sentences are provided in a separate overview.

## notebooks
Contains three Jupyter Notebooks exploring different aspects relating to the MultiPic databse, which serve as base for more concise Python scripts and generally the creation of our questionnaire.

## src
Contains source code exclusively needed for the questionnaire creation. (Other code that is also relevant for the estimate analysis can be found in [external_resources](../external_resources/).)
