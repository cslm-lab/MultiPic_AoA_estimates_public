# Exploratory notebooks
- `Exploring_German_MultiPic.ipynb`: Exploration of the German MultiPic databases version 1 and 5 and their potential combination with the norms from Schr√∂der et al. (2011) and Birchenough et al. (2016)
- `exploring_frequencies.ipynb`: Exploration of SUBTLEX-DE frequency database, how it aligns with MultiPic items, and ultimately how these databases can be combined in a sensible manner.
- `selecting_items.ipynb`: Shows our reasoning process in how to select items for the familiarisation phase, how to distribute items over 3 disjoint lists, how to select control items that are the same for all lists, and repeating items per list. For a concise and implementation see [items_lists.py](../src/items_lists.py).

*Note:* These notebooks serve to illustrate the decisions made in our process of developing the age-of-acquisition study. 
More concise collections of the utilised code can be found in the provided Python scripts.
