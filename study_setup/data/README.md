- **items_lists:** Contains information about the distribution of MultiPic items across 3 lists (A/B/C), items that were shared across lists (`shared_items_list.csv`) and items that were repeated within lists (which have the addendum `_repeated`). Additionally it contains information about the 10 familiarisation items used (`familiarisation_items_overview.csv`).
- `example_sentences.ods`: A collection of the example sentences used for each presented item. The file has two sheets: `MultiPic` which contains example sentences for all MultiPic items, and `Familiarisation` which contains example sentences for all familiarisation items.
- `english_translation.ods`: English translation of the target items and their example sentences. The file again contains two sheets: `MultiPic` which contains example sentences for all MultiPic items, and `Familiarisation` which contains example sentences for all familiarisation items.
For the `MultiPic` sheet, the column `CHANGED` indicates whether an existing English MultiPic word item was changed to better reflect the German meaning (1) or was taken as it was (0).
